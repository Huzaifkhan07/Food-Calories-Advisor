# Food Calories Advisor

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ This is my **Food Calories Advisor** app, built with Python and Streamlit. This app helps users get a quick nutritional analysis by uploading images of food items. Using Googleâ€™s Gemini API, the app identifies each item, calculates calories, and gives a recommendation on whether the food is healthy or not.

## What I've Done
- **Image Upload & Display**: Allows users to upload food images (JPG, PNG, JPEG) and shows the image on the screen.
- **Calorie Calculation**: Uses the Google Gemini model to identify food items from the image and calculate calories for each one.
- **Health Recommendation**: Based on calorie information, the app gives an assessment of whether the food is healthy.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: All the backend logic and API integration.
- **Streamlit**: For the user interface, making it easy to upload and view images.
- **Google Cloud (Gemini API)**: To process and analyze the image content.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing in Python.
- **dotenv**: To securely load environment variables like API keys.

## Key Functions
- **get_gemini_response()**: This function connects with the Google Gemini model to analyze food images and get calorie info.
- **input_image_setup()**: Prepares the uploaded image in the format required for analysis.
